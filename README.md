**AI-driven** media creation and editing with a friendly UI and a backend API for integration with third-party services.

This platform ensures effortless deployment and management of AI-powered, secure workflows, tailor-made for the efficient processing of images and videos.

> [!NOTE]
> The project is currently in the planning-development stage, first release will arrive soon.

## The main goals of the project are as follows:

1. To automate deployment and installation processes of ComfyUI workflows.
2. To utilize only proven workflows and extensions for handling pictures and videos.
3. To avoid adding anything unnecessary or questionable from a security perspective.
4. To provide a convenient API for external services.
5. To ensure an easy and simple user interface for individual users.

*Main principles are: reliability, safety, and simplicity.*
